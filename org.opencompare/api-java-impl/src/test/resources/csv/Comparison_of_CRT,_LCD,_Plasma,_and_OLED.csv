"Other","No native resolution. Currently, the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling). Display lag is extremely low due to its nature, which does not have the ability to store image data before output, unlike LCDs, plasma displays and OLED displays.","The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality.","Screen-door effects are more noticeable than LCD when up close, or on larger sizes;","/!\ This cell is not defined /!\"
