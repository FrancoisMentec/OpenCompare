This is a '''comparison of online music storage services''', Internet services that allow uploads of personally owned or licensed music to the [[Cloud storage|cloud]] for listening on multiple devices.

There are currently three large services, each incorporating an [[online music store]] (see [[comparison of online music stores|comparison]]), with purchased songs from the associated music store not counting toward storage limits. Other than additional storage space, the main additional feature provided with an annual fee by Amazon and Apple is "scan-and-match", which examines music files on a computer and adds a copy of matched tracks to the user's music locker without having to upload the files.  Google provides both a large amount of storage space and the scan-and-match feature at no cost.

Amazon was the first of the currently significant players to launch their cloud music locker service in late March 2011.  Amazon launched without obtaining any new music streaming licenses, which upset the major record labels.  Google launched their service less than a month and a half later, also without obtaining any new licenses.  Apple negotiated with the major record labels for a new license before launching their service six months after Google's.  Amazon and Google eventually negotiated licenses before launching their scan-and-match features.

For streaming services where a person is unable to upload their own music, but is limited to music provided by the service, such as [[Pandora Radio]] and [[Spotify]], see [[Comparison of on-demand streaming music services]].  See that article also for information on subscription streaming services provided by three of the companies below ([[Google Play Music All Access]], Apple's [[iTunes Radio]], and Amazon's [[Prime Music]]).

== Comparison ==

Major differences between the services are Google offering scan-and-match and a large amount of storage as no-cost features, whereas others usually offer limited or no storage space for free and scan and match only with an annual fee.  For users with extremely large libraries, Amazon offers the most storage space for a reasonable annual fee.

Amazon does not allow [[podcast]]s, ringtones, or [[audiobook]]s to be uploaded.  Apple does not allow audiobooks or podcasts to be uploaded.
