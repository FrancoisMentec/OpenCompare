obama supports expanding trade only if the united states' trade partners place labor and environmental standards on their industries to "level the playing field" for american interests. if elected president, obama plans to renegotiate nafta to include stricter labor and environmental standards for canada and mexico. he has criticized the current agreement for not including such standards, and he also voted against and criticized the central america free trade agreement (cafta) for similar reasons.

baldwin would lead the us out of the north american and the central america free trade agreement. he would impose a revenue tariff.
barr's campaign site states that america "should encourage private involvement around the world, particularly through free trade. the most effective way to preserve peace is through an expanding free market, backed by a full range of cultural and other private relationships".
mckinney stresses enacting laws on us corporations to keep labor standards high at home and raise them abroad. she would repeal nafta (north american free trade agreement), cafta, the caribbean fta, and us-peru fta. she opposes the guest-worker program as riddled with abuses; supports justice for immigrant workers, and immigrant reform that includes amnesty and a path to legalization for undocumented people who have been living and working in the us for years.
nader views nafta and the wto as subverting national regulatory agencies. he blames them for diminishing standards of living (i.e. race to the bottom). nader supports a constitutional amendment asserting the "sovereignty of people over the power of corporations."

mccain favors tax credits of up to $5,000 for families that purchase health insurance.

obama's health care plan includes implementing guaranteed eligibility for affordable health care for all americans. his plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 18 million by 2009 and 34 million by 2018, covering nearly all children, while raising the national debt by $1.6 trillion over 10 years, according to one estimate.

wants to cut costs by reducing controls and regulations. believes medicare and medicaid are financially unstable, and "need to be transformed to emphasize patient choice, focus on the truly needy, and add cost-saving incentives."
co-sponsored every bill in congress to create a system of universal health care under a single payer model. opposes forced, coerced, or uninformed medication and sterilization; believes americans should be able to purchase drugs from other countries if the price is cheaper, and the u.s. should negotiate with drug companies to provide cheaper drugs for all u.s. residents.

while mccain has historically favored deficit reduction over tax cuts, he has pledged not to rescind recent tax cuts in combination with reduced spending. mccain believes that lower taxes will stimulate the economy, and that the current deficit owes more to overspending than to tax cuts. mccain plans to balance the budget by the end of his first term. according to the tax policy center, mccain's tax plans (by extending the bush tax cuts and cutting corporate tax rates from 35% to 25% to increase investment, among other measures), would increase the national debt by nearly $5 trillion over 10 years, a nearly 50% increase.

obama advocates responding to the "precarious budget situation" by eliminating "tax credits that have outlived their usefulness", closing corporate tax loopholes, and restoring the paygo policy that prohibits increases in federal spending without a way to compensate for the lost revenue. obama proposes extending the bush tax cuts for low- and middle-income families, while letting taxes go back up for individuals earning over $200,000 or couples earning over $250,000.

baldwin would work to repeal the sixteenth amendment (income tax), inheritance taxes, and property taxes. "we are bankrupting our country with this incessant and burdensome tax system."
barr supports repealing the sixteenth amendment and mentions the fair tax as a possible alternative. "meaningful tax reform begins with reining in government spending."
would repeal bush tax cuts for top 1% of income earners; close tax loopholes; tax corporations more; and deny federal subsidies to those who relocate jobs overseas. proposes to regain control of the monetary system and respond to the current economic crisis, by steps that include a moratorium on foreclosures; elimination of all arm mortgages and their renegotiation into 30- or 40-year loans; establishment of new mortgage lending practices to end predatory and discriminatory practices; funds targeted at cushioning job loss and retraining of those at the bottom of the income scale as the economy transitions; appointment of former comptroller general david walker to fully audit all recipients of taxpayer cash infusions, including jp morgan, bear stearns, fannie mae, freddie mac, and aig, and to monitor their trading activities into the future; elimination of all derivatives trading; nationalization of the federal reserve and the establishment of a federally owned, public banking system that makes credit available for small businesses, homeowners, manufacturing operations, renewable energy, and infrastructure investments; criminal prosecution of any conflicts of interest that led to the current crisis.
nader opposes corporate welfare and seeks to end corporate loopholes, exemptions, credits, accelerated depreciation schedules, deductions, and targeted exceptions. he would balance the national budget by cutting military spending by $100 billion, or about a fifth, and through sharply progressive taxation.

in june 1999, mccain said "the only way to increase the yield on social security dollars is by allowing workers to make investment decisions for themselves; by empowering american families to invest, in most robust portfolios, a portion of their earnings for social security that they would otherwise pay in taxes to social security." in january 2000, he repeated his strong support for creating private social security accounts. partial privatization, or diverting payroll taxes to private accounts, would reduce available funds for current retirees significantly, requiring large debt increases to cover the transition.

obama has said that social security's funding problem is "real but manageable." he has proposed to fund social security by applying payroll taxes to individual income above $250,000 per year, and says that these high-income earners should "pay their fair share." when asked if he would consider raising the retirement age or cutting benefits, obama did not rule these approaches out entirely, saying, "everything should be on the table." however, he has said that he would not push for either of those approaches, and says that an increase in tax revenue is necessary to stabilize the system. obama opposes adding personal accounts to social security.

social security is not sustainable. social security should be changed to an "individualized system of private accounts."
mckinney strongly opposes privatizing social security, and recognizes cuts disproportionately harm women. she believes tax payments on benefits should be reduced, and benefits increased.
nader views social security as "government as it should work – a coming together of society to ensure that we, as a community, take care of each other as we age or suffer from disabilities." nader opposes a privatized system that would replace "systemic tranquility with an enforced anxiety". he says people are already able to take risk in the stock market through ira, 401k and other tax-subsidized private retirement devices.

impose a revenue tariff on all foreign goods to keep jobs in america.

wants to repeal the anti-union taft-hartley act. supports full employment and a living wage for all workers. supports justice for immigrant workers, and opposes guest-worker programs as riddled with abuses. opposes 'free trade' agreements and unelected international trade authorities (nafta, cafta, wto, gatt, 'fast track', etc.) that give corporate power and profit priority over labor rights and environmental protections; mckinney has voted against these agreements and advocates withdrawal. human rights protections and amnesty for undocumented immigrants, an end to raids, and tearing down the border wall; believes the flood of new immigrants is a result of economic policies and agreements (e.g., nafta) that impoverish people and drive them across borders, and that immigration should be addressed by fixing these policies while ensuring worker rights and right to organize. favors a strong safety net for middle- and low-income working people and families, with support for main street (small businesses and local economies) instead of wall street, and a massive transfer of federal funding from military contract and war spending to human needs.
nader promises to repeal the taft-hartley act. he supports an increase in the minimum wage to $10 an hour to give low-wage workers "a fair return for their work". nader supports family farms and opposes large agribusiness. he is credited with helping pass the mine health and safety act (1977), whistleblower protection act (1989), and osha (1970) – all three are fundamental to modern labor protection.

us should stop weapons transfers to middle east countries, including israel—and be "honest broker." in terms of two- versus one-state solution, would listen to the voices and human rights advocates who are there.
nader supports the israeli peace movement and views resolution of the israeli-palestinian conflict as central to national security. nader was critical of the us-supported bombing of lebanon in 2006, seeing it as collective punishment. nader wants enforcement of un resolutions concerning israel and a peaceful two-state solution.

baldwin has stated that the us's involvement in iraq is clearly unconstitutional as well as unnecessary, and would begin safely withdrawing troops.
barr considers the invasion and occupation of iraq to have been mistakes. american presence "emboldens both insurgents and terrorists", and has cost "hundreds of billions of u.s. taxpayer dollars." he supports "withdrawal without undue delay."
mckinney calls for the immediate and orderly withdrawal of all us troops and contracted personnel from iraq and afghanistan; she would dismantle us military bases in the area, and demand that us and other international corporations relinquish any claims to iraqi oil or other resources. she has consistently opposed funding for the war and the military budget.
nader opposes the us occupation of iraq on the grounds that “it’s the occupation that is breeding the resistance.” he supports a “responsible, orderly withdrawal” within six months. following withdrawal, he supports inclusion of an international peacekeeping force under un auspices, promotion of iraqi self-rule through independent elections, and the providing of humanitarian aid to stabilize the country.

mckinney supports full reproductive rights for women, including safe access to comprehensive prenatal and postnatal/infant care; family planning services and contraception, including "morning after" medication; and abortion. she rejects forced, coerced, or uninformed medication and sterilization, and supports single-payer universal healthcare.
nader is opposed to legal restrictions on abortion, "i don't think government has the proper role in forcing a woman to have a child or forcing a woman not to have a child... this is something that should be privately decided with the family, woman, all the other private factors of it, but we should work toward preventing the necessity of abortion."

baldwin would enforce visa rules, and does not support a "path to citizenship"/amnesty for aliens currently residing in the us illegally. employers who knowingly hire illegals would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. would end "birthright citizenship", and thus end the problem of "anchor babies". no federal monies would be used for any services to illegal aliens.
supports better border security to crack down on illegal immigration while also supporting reforms that will "sharply increase" legal immigration. supports ending birthright citizenship and ending government benefits and services for illegal immigrants.
mckinney believes the wave of new immigration is a result of economic policies and agreements (e.g., nafta) that impoverish people and drive them across borders. she opposes the guest-worker program as riddled with abuses, and support human rights protections and amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally, an end to raids, and tearing down the border wall.
nader does not support open border, which he says will create a "cheap-wage policy" for businesses. he supports giving illegal workers, who have their taxes withheld, the same labor standards and benefits as american workers. he says the government should "crack down" on employers and stop "brain drain" third world countries with h-1b visas.
