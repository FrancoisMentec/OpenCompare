{"class":"pcm.Cell@6428803251426087284897","content":"From 1933-2011 there was a two-thirds requirement for general fund appropriations for purposes other than public schools (Const., Art. IV, Sec. 12). Because the Legislature typically passes one main budget bill, the requirement effectively applied to the whole budget bill. There has been a two-thirds requirement for tax increases since Proposition 13 in 1978. In 2010, voters approved Proposition 25, eliminating the 2/3 requirement for the budget, but keeping it for tax increases.","generated_KMF_ID":"6428803251426087284897","feature":["features[8409813661426087284897]"],"interpretation":[]}
