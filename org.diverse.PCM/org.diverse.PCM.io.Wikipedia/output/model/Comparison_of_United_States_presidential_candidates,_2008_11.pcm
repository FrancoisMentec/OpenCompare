He supports an increase in the minimum wage to $10 an hour to give low-wage workers \"a fair return for their work\". Nader supports family farms and opposes large agribusiness. He is credited with helping pass the Mine Health and Safety Act (1977), Whistleblower Protection Act (1989), and OSHA (1970) â€“ all three are fundamental to modern labor protection.","generated_KMF_ID":"2659092541426087264500","feature":["features[14549252531426087264500]"],"interpretation":[]}

Supports justice for immigrant workers, and opposes guest-worker programs as riddled with abuses.  Opposes 'free trade' agreements and unelected international trade authorities (NAFTA, CAFTA, WTO, GATT, 'Fast Track', etc.) that give corporate power and profit priority over labor rights and environmental protections; McKinney has voted against these agreements and advocates withdrawal. Human rights protections and amnesty for undocumented immigrants, an end to raids, and tearing down the border wall; believes the flood of new immigrants is a result of economic policies and agreements (e.g., NAFTA) that impoverish people and drive them across borders, and that immigration should be addressed by fixing these policies while ensuring worker rights and right to organize. Favors a strong safety net for middle- and low-income working people and families, with support for Main Street (small businesses and local economies) instead of Wall Street, and a massive transfer of federal funding from military contract and war spending to human needs.","generated_KMF_ID":"20238150411426087264500","feature":["features[14549252531426087264500]"],"interpretation":[]}
