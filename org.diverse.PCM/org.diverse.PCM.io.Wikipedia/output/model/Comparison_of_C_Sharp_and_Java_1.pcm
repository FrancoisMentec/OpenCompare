The value set of a C# enumeration is defined by the underlying type that can be a signed or unsigned integer type of 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits. The enumeration definition defines names for the selected integer values. By default the first name is assigned the value 0 (zero) and the following names are assigned in increments of 1.
