[[File:DutchAfrikaans.svg|thumb|right|300px|Dutch and Afrikaans]]

'''[[Afrikaans]]''' is a daughter language of '''Dutch''' and—unlike Netherlands Dutch, Belgian Dutch and [[Surinamese Dutch]]—a separate [[standard language]] rather than a [[Variety (linguistics)|national variety]]. As an estimated 90 to 95% of Afrikaans vocabulary is ultimately of Dutch origin, there are few lexical differences between the two languages; however, Afrikaans has a considerably more regular [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], grammar, and spelling. There is a degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] between the two languages, particularly in written form.

[[Afrikaans]] acquired some lexical and syntactical borrowings from other languages such as [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Khoisan languages|Khoi and San languages]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and of the [[Bantu languages]], and to a lesser extent, Low German. Nevertheless, Dutch-speakers are confronted with fewer non-[[cognates]] when listening to Afrikaans than the other way round. Mutual intelligibility thus tends to be asymmetrical, as it is easier for Dutch-speakers to understand Afrikaans than for Afrikaans-speakers to understand Dutch. In general, research suggests that mutual intelligibility between Dutch and Afrikaans is better than between Dutch and [[West Frisian language|Frisian]] or [[North Germanic languages#Mutual intelligibility|between]] [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

==General differences==

===Orthographic differences===
Orthographic differences between Dutch and Afrikaans are mainly due to phonetic evolutions and spelling simplifications in Afrikaans, and the more conservative character of and recent changes to modern Dutch orthography.

====Afrikaans simplifications====
* The Dutch digraph '''<[[IJ (digraph)|ij]]>'''  was converted to '''<y>''' in Afrikaans, although pronunciation remained <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[ɛi]</span>. An example is "prijs" (price), which is spelt "prys" in Afrikaans. Dutch words ''ending'' in '''<lijk>''', however, end in '''<lik>''' in Afrikaans, not <lyk>, for example "lelijk" (ugly) in Dutch becomes "lelik" in Afrikaans. In both languages, this suffix is pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[lək]</span>, with a [[schwa]].
* Afrikaans uses '''<k>''' for the Dutch hard '''<c>''', both pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[k]</span>. Compare Dutch "cultuur" (culture) with Afrikaans "kultuur". Before the 1990s major spelling reform, the latter spelling was also accepted in Dutch.
* Afrikaans merged Dutch trigraphs '''<tie>''' and '''<cie>''' to a single spelling '''<sie>'''. Apart from <tie>, which is pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[tsi]</span> in the Netherlands, there is no difference in pronunciation. Compare Dutch words "provincie" (province) and "politie" (police) with "provinsie" and "polisie" in Afrikaans.
* The Dutch cluster '''<tion>''' became '''<sion>''' in Afrikaans. Compare "nationaal" (national) with "nasionaal". In Dutch, the pronunciation differs from region to region and include <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[tsiɔn]</span>, <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[siɔn]</span>, and <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[ʃon]</span>.
* Afrikaans merged Dutch digraphs and trigraphs '''<ou>''', '''<ouw>''',  '''<au>''', and  '''<auw>''' - pronounced identically by many Dutch speakers - to a single spelling <ou>. Compare Dutch "vrouw" (woman) and "dauw" (dew) with Afrikaans "vrou" and "dou" respectively.
* At the end of words, Afrikaans often dropped the <n> in the Dutch cluster '''<en>''' (pronounced as a schwa, <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[ə]</span>), mainly present in single nouns and plurals, to become '''<e>'''. Compare Dutch "leven" (life) and "mensen" (people) to Afrikaans "lewe" and "mense".

====Phonetically induced spelling differences====
Afrikaans frequently has simplified consonant clusters in final position that are still present in Dutch.

* Afrikaans merged Dutch consonants '''<z>''' and '''''' to a single sound <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[s]</span>, spelt . A similar phonetic evolution can be found in the Northern Netherlands. Dutch "zorg" (care) became "sorg" in Afrikaans.
* In the middle of words, Afrikaans merged Dutch '''<v>''' and '''<w>''' to a single sound <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[v]</span> and consequently to a single spelling, <w>. Compare Dutch "haven" (port) with Afrikaans "hawe", both pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[ɦaːvə]</span>. A similar near-assimilation of <w> to <v> can also be found in the Northern Netherlands, where <w> is pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">ʋ</span>, and <v> <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">v</span>.
* Afrikaans merged Dutch fricatives '''<ch>''' and '''<g>''' to a single sound <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[χ]</span>, spelt <g>, unless it is preceded by  in which case <sk> is used. A similar phonetic evolution can be heard in the Northern Netherlands, where the sounds have also been merged to <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[χ]</span> or <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[x]</span>, although the spelling difference has been retained. In Belgium and Suriname, however, the phonetic distinction between <ch> and <g> has been preserved.
* Syllable-initially, Afrikaans spells '''<sk>''' (pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[sk]</span>) where Dutch uses '''<sch>''' (pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[sx]</span>, <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[sχ]</span> or <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[sç]</span>): compare Dutch "school" (school) with Afrikaans "skool". In some Dutch dialects, notably Southern [[West Flemish]], <sk> can also be heard.
* At the end of words, Dutch clusters '''<cht>''' and '''<st>''' were reduced to '''<g>''' and ''' ''', respectively, in Afrikaans. Compare Dutch "lucht" (air, pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[lʏxt]</span>) and "dienst" (service, pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[dinst]</span>) with Afrikaans "lug" (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[ləχ]</span>) and "diens" (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[dins]</span>).
* Between two vowels, the Dutch '''<g>''' and '''<v>''' are omitted in Afrikaans. Compare Dutch "hoger" (higher) and "regen" (rain) with Afrikaans "hoër" and "reën", where the second vowel requires a [[umlaut (diacritic)|trema]] to avoid confusion with the digraphs <oe> and <ee>.
* At the end of words, Dutch '''<g>''' is sometimes omitted in Afrikaans, which opens up the preceding vowels, now written with a [[circumflex]]. For example, the Dutch verb form "zeg" (say, pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[zɛx]</span>) became "sê" (pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[seː]</span>) in Afrikaans.
* Afrikaans '''<ê>''', '''<ô>''', '''<û>''' contrast with Dutch, where the use of the [[circumflex]] is essentially limited to French borrowings. A circumflex is used with single vowel letters in open syllables, indicating the long monophthongal pronunciations /eː/ or /ɛː/, /ɔː/ and /œː/, as opposed to the vowel letters without a circumflex, pronounced as /eə/, /oə/ and /y/, respectively. Examples include "wêreld" (world, Dutch "wereld"), "môre" (morning, Dutch "morgen"), and "brûe" (bridges, Dutch "bruggen").
* In diminutive forms, Afrikaans uses '''<tjie>''' (pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[ki]</span>) where Standard Dutch uses '''<tje>''' (pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[cə]</span>). In Belgium and the Southern Netherlands, the diminutive is often realised as <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[kə]</span> in the spoken language.

===Phonetic differences===
See [[Wikipedia:IPA for Dutch and Afrikaans]].
Afrikaans pronunciation tends to be closest to the dialects of the province [[South Holland]], in particular of [[Zoetermeer]].

* At the start of words, Afrikaans often merged Dutch voiced '''<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[v]</span>''' with voiceless '''<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[f]</span>''', as in "ver" (far), pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[fɛr]</span> in Afrikaans and <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[vɛr]</span> in Standard Dutch. The same merger is present though in the areas around Amsterdam, where all voiced consonants merged with the voiceless ones, pronounced as the latter ones.
* Afrikaans merged Dutch voiced '''<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[w]</span>''' with voiced '''<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[v]</span>''', as in "werk" (work), pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[vɛrk]</span> in Afrikaans and <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[wɛrk]</span> in Belgium and Suriname or <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class="IPA">[ʋɛrk]</span> in the Netherlands.

===Grammar differences===
Grammar differences are arguably the most considerable difference between Dutch and Afrikaans.

*Afrikaans, unlike Dutch, has no [[grammatical gender]]. Therefore, Afrikaans only has one form of the [[definite article]] ''die'', while standard Dutch has two (''de'' and ''het'') and spoken South-Dutch has three (''den'', ''de'' and ''het'').
*In Afrikaans verbs, the same form is generally used for both the infinitive and the present tense (with a couple of notable exceptions), and there is no inflection for person. Afrikaans has dropped the perfect tense for all but eight verbs, using instead the imperfect or the present tense, depending on context. Afrikaans has also lost the pluperfect. Afrikaans also lacks the distinction between the [[subject pronoun|subject]] and [[object pronoun|object]] form for plural [[personal pronouns]].
* Unlike Dutch, Afrikaans has dropped the distinction between verbs that use ''zijn'' (to be) and verbs that use ''hebben'' (to have) in the present perfect.
* The past tense of the passive voice uses ''is'' instead of ''werd''. In Dutch, the passive voice can be constructed by both ''zijn'' and ''worden''.
* Afrikaans has a [[double negative]], which is absent in standard Dutch (yet still exists in some dialects like [[West Flemish]]). For example, Dutch ''Ik spreek '''geen''' Engels'' (I do not speak English) in Afrikaans becomes ''Ek praat '''nie''' Engels '''nie'''.'' Similar constructions can be found in French (''Je <u>ne</u> parle <u>pas</u> anglais'') but also in West Flemish (''k <u>en<u> klappe <u>geen<u> Engels'') as well as in other dialects in the southern part of Holland (''Ik praat geen Engels nie'')
*Like Dutch, adjectives are generally inflected (with a number of exceptions) in the attributive position (when preceding the noun) and not in the predicative.  Unlike Dutch, this inflection depends only on position, not grammatical gender.

==Influences from other languages==

=== Malay ===
Due to the early settlement of a [[Cape Malay]] community in [[Cape Town]], who are now known as [[coloureds]], numerous Malay words were brought into Afrikaans. Some of these words entered Dutch via the [[Indonesian language]] as part of the colonial heritage. Malay words in Afrikaans include:
*'''Piesang''', which means [[banana]]. This is different from the common Dutch word ''banaan''. The word ''pisang'' is also used in Dutch, though usage is less common.
*'''Baie''', which means 'very'/'much'/'many' (from [[:en:wiktionary:banyak|'banyak']]) is a very commonly used Afrikaans word, different from its Dutch equivalent ''veel'' or ''erg''.
*'''Baadjie''', Afrikaans for [[jacket]], where Dutch would use ''jas'' or ''vest''. The word ''baadje'' in Dutch is now considered archaic and only used in written, literary texts.

===Portuguese===
Some words originally came from Portuguese such as ''sambreel'' (''umbrella'') from the Portuguese ''sombreiro'', ''kraal'' (''pen/cattle enclosure'') from the Portuguese ''curral'', and ''mielie'' (''corn'', from ''milho''). These words have become common in South Africa to an extent of being used in many other [[Languages of South Africa|South African languages]]. Some of these words also exist in Dutch, like ''sambreel'' "parasol", ''kraal'' "cattle enclosure", and mielie "corn, grain", though usage is less common and meanings can slightly differ.

===Khoisan languages===
The word ''gogga'', meaning insect, comes from the [[Khoisan]] word of the same meaning, ''xo-xo''. Various other words used in Afrikaans also come from the [[Khoisan languages]], such as ''assegaai'' (''spear''), ''karos'' (''blanket of animal hides''), and ''dagga'' (''marijuana''). Some of these words also exist in Dutch, though with a more specific meaning: ''assegaai'' for example means "South-African tribal javelin" and ''karos'' means "South-African tribal blanket of animal hides".

===Bantu languages===
The following words are some of the many [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] words that have been adapted for use in both Afrikaans ''and'' [[South African English]].
*'''Chana''', from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word ''umtshana''. Used to refer to a friend.
*'''Fundi''', from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word ''umfundisa''. Meaning someone who is an expert on a certain subject, i.e. ''He is a language fundi.''
*'''Tjaila / tjailatyd''', an adaption of the word ''Chaila'', meaning 'to go home'
